## Strategic Purpose
This website is created to be the official marketing tool for my business "Wild Thing Yoga".
It should be an asset to the business to increase growth and improve rates of student retention 
while also being of value to the students and improving their customer experience.

The site will be a place for students and potential students to learn about our offering, 
book classes, contact us and avail of free resources. 

Features are to entice new students to join classes, add value for existing students while also cutting down 
on correspondance for the business, regarding frequently asked questions and errors caused by typo's
or lack of information. 

Content should be clear, informative and adapted for screen readers so it is accessible for all.
The site is to be responsive on all devices, while being easy and enjoyable to navigate through. 
Creating a positive user experience for customers that they will return to again and again.

### Design Simulation

The live site can be found <a href="https://janeyrinn.github.io/Wild_Thing_Yoga/" target="_blank">here</a>

## User Experience Design

### User Stories
#### First Time and Returning Visitor Goals

As a user I would like to : 
>- easily understands the main purpose and navigation pathways of the site.
>- find information is clearly presented and easily absorbed with minimal effort.
>- find that features load quickly.
>- find that features are adapted to my devices screen size.
>- learn more about the companys offering.
>- have basic questions I may have answered without having to contact the organization.
>- learn about their interaction with others via social media. 
>- learn about their service quality through testimonials.
>- easily learn of upcoming classes.
>- learn about price of their classes.
>- book classes.
>- access contact information.
>- find their location.
>- contact the organization.
>- avail of free resources.

### Design
#### Structure

The site will be made up of 3 pages with 2 to 3 sections on each page, all pages will have a
'sticky' navigation bar and a footer containing contact information. 

The Home page will have links to book a class, images of the studio and past classes,
testimonials, frequently asked questions and an option to submit a question.

The booking page will have our class schedule, pricing information and a booking form.

The free resources page will have topical articals and online tutorials, which will be updated 
reguarly.

#### Wireframes
A mock up of how the site will be layed out is available here via [Wire Frames](assets/wireframes.pdf).

#### Color Scheme

<img src="assets/images/readme/swatch.png" alt="color-swatch">

The above color swatch shows a guide line for the color scheme of the site, 
black and white will also be incorporated.
Colors are brand colors which have been adopted for the following reasons:
<br>

Color | Consumer Association
------|---------------------
Black | Elegance, sophistication
Beige | Neutral, calming, relaxing, dependable
Green | Growth, recurrance, safety & balance
White | Goodness, purity, safety & new beginnings
Blue  | Serenity, reliable
Grey  | Neutral, balance

All colours tie together to make the appropriate emotional responce
and associations the brands identifies with their business, yoga 
and a yoga practice. The colours also combine for effective and an easy to 
read layout. <br>

<em>Please see [credits](#Credits) section for links to color psychology sources.</em>

#### Typography

The Dancing Script font, created by [<em>Pablo Impallari</em>](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Dancing+Script?query=dancing#about) will be the main font for
the company name and headings, Raleway which is hosted on google fonts also, by multiple creators,
will be the secondary font used for the body of text. Sans Serif will be the fallback font
if for any reason the main fonts are not being imported or displayed correctly. 
This pairing has clean lines, with a good contrast in weight and lends well to a sense of 
profesionalism.

#### Imagery
Branding is an important marketing tool so a logo has been developed using 
[<em>Canva.com</em>](https://www.canva.com/),
this logo will feature throughout the website. Images will be supplied
by myself or from open sources,  please see [<em>credits</em>](#credits) for a list of sources and photographers.

#### Design Limitations
A fourth and fifth page for a members log in and merchandise/equipment shop
will be implimented in the future but was not possible due to time constraints. The forms
are not functioning for the business at present and do not have method="POST" or "action=" included as there is no where to "post" to yet. 
This is due to the mechanisms of that feature being outside the scope of the project.

#### Design Differences
An additional table was added to the Pricing & Schedule page after the wireframes were created.
The footer in the wireframes is a little different from execution but the concept and desired function is ultimately the same.

## Testing

Testing is will be carried out under three premises : User Stories,the Businesses Strategic purpose and features.

Testing will be for 3 browsers : Chrome v87, Microsoft Edge v87 & Mozilla Firefox v83.

Testing was documented using Microsoft Excel and the full spreadsheet can be found [here](/assets/testing.xlsx).
Screen schots of all results are below.

HTML and CSS  semantics and validity was tested through out with [W3C](https://validator.w3.org/) for HTML
and [W3c Jigsaw](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) for CSS.

##### Bugs and Fixes

- Jumbotron sizing issues : The jumbotron and booking button were not responsive on different screen sizes.
This was combatted with reducing the font size of the "h1" element and targeted @MediaQueries. The font size increases for screens
of 1200px and above, for screen sizes of 768px width and below the font size reduces and the top margin increasess.
The margin increase is to push the "h1" out from under the NavBar. The button reduces in size with a media query also
for screens 850px and below. Widths were determined by researching break points and through trial and error testing.
- Brand text in the NavBar sizing issue: The brand text in the nav bar is also controlled for resposivness with 
media queries as it was too large in some screens and sending the toggle button below the logo. This still happens 
but only on very small screens and is part of the bootstrap design. The brand text now decreases in size on smaller screens 
and completely dissapears on very small screens.
- Carousel: the way the carousel was origianally written in the HTML it was creating a white space to the right of the 
hero image. The carousel was placed inside a container "div" to combat this.
- Deployed links: Internal links were not working when the site was first deployed. File paths were updated 
to include the website name to show the correct location in the public site.
- Footer display: the font in the footer wasn't as strong and easily read as I had hoped and this was combatted by adding a
text shadow.

##### Testing Limitations
Testing was limited to the three browsers mentioned above, although I had wished to have the site function on Safari
as it is a popular browser I could not. I do not own an Apple Mac or Tablet and you can no longer download Safari for Windows.I reached out to colleagues
and friends to assist with Safari testing but I am not confident to include the results for the purpose of the MS1.
