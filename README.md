#### Color Scheme

<img align="center" src="assets/images/readMe/swatch.PNG">

The above color swatch shows a guide line for the color scheme of the site, 
black and white will also be incorporated.
Colors are brand colors which have been adopted for the following reasons:<br>
<br>

Color | Consumer Association
------|---------------------
Black | Elegance, sophistication
Beige | Neutral, calming, relaxing, dependable
Green | Growth, recurrance, safety & balance
White | Goodness, purity, safety & new beginnings
Blue  | Serenity, reliable
Grey  | Neutral, balance

All colours tie together to make the appropriate emotional responce
and associations the brands identifies with their business, yoga 
and a yoga practice. The colours also combine for effective and an easy to 
read layout. <br>

<em>Please see [credits](#Credits) section for links to color psychology sources.</em>

#### Typography

The Sanchez font, created by [<em>Daniel Hernandez</em>](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Sanchez?query=sanchez) will be the main font for
the company name and headings, Raleway which is hosted on google fonts also, by multiple creators,
will be the secondary font used for the body of text. Sans Serif will be the fallback font
if for any reason the main fonts are not being imported or displayed correctly. 
This pairing has clean lines, with a good contrast in weight and lends well to a sense of 
profesionalism.

#### Imagery
Branding is an important marketing tool so a logo has been developed using 
[<em>Canva.com</em>](https://www.canva.com/design/DAEOhUvrb0E/PlrtIsOaalfq_bSkxw6D8w/edit?layoutQuery=lotus+logo),
this logo will feature throughout the website. Images will be supplied
by myself or from open sources,  please see [<em>credits</em>](#credits) for a list of sources and photographers.

#### Design Limitations
A more modern layout was originally designed but outside the scope of 
my current capabilities. A fourth and fifth page for a community forum and merchandise/equipment shop
will be implimented in the future but was not possible due to time constraints. The forms
are also limited in function, as that is outside the scope of the project and my capabilities at this time.
