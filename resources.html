                                        <p>By Kathryn Ashworth, for Yoga International</p>
                                        <p class="article-p rounded">
                                            When Ram Dass returned from India in the 1970s after spending countless hours with his guru, Neem Karoli Baba (lovingly known as Maharajji), his newfound purpose was to introduce the concept of
                                            guru to Western minds. What followed was a series of books (the first being the classic spiritual text, Be Here Now), more than three decades of lectures, and the Love Serve Remember Foundation,
                                            an organization which—through the use of webcasts, private “Heart 2 Hearts” with Ram Dass, online courses, and eBooks—tirelessly continues the teachings of Maharajji. I recently contacted Ram Dass
                                            to discuss various topics he has touched upon throughout his years of teaching—from devotion to surrender, accessing our inherent intuition, and more. Ram Dass currently lives in Maui. One of his
                                            most poignant and timeless teachings is that spiritual seekers can “come close to God” through every experience—even our suffering. The film Fierce Grace documents his own very personal experience
                                            with this concept that suffering can bring us closer to God, as it (in part) features Dass’ emotional, physical, and spiritual transformation after he was—in his own words—“stroked” in 1997.Ram
                                            Dass’ practice is to witness the cosmic hand behind all experiences—throughout it all, he sees grace—and he invites us all to do the same. The following is a conversation that can remind us all to
                                            love more, and to find the perfection in embracing who we are.
                                            <br />
                                            <br />
                                            <b>Since meeting your guru, Maharajji, in the 1960s, you’ve devoted your life to his teachings. Your name itself means “servant of God.” What does it mean to be devoted?</b><br />
                                            What it means to be devoted is to be in an unconditional Love relationship between you and the Beloved. When I met Maharajji, he gave me unconditional love, and that was my first experience of
                                            true love. That experience has been nurtured over all these years by His grace. And now that devotion has become a constant inner dialogue with Maharajji.
                                            <br />
                                            <br />
                                            <b>How does guru's grace manifest in practice?</b><br />
                                            Guru’s grace is manifested as whatever practice brings you closer to God. The guru brings you into contact with what is perfect for you to get free. That includes the awareness to transform
                                            suffering into grace—as what happened to me when my body was stroked.
                                            <br />
                                            <br />
                                            <b>You once said, “When you learn how to listen, everybody is the guru.” Could you tell us what this means?</b>
                                            When you can sit quietly and have your spiritual heart be the perspective from which you see your life, you can see how each event, each arising of phenomena is grist for the mill of your
                                            awakening. So indeed each person you meet offers a specific teaching, and they become what’s called in India “Upa Guru”—anyone and everyone who crosses our path has come to teach us something.
